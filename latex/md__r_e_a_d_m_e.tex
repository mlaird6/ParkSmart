Park\+Smart provides detailed parking lot availability data to users. Our application will classify each parking spot in the lot as either taken or available and report the data to users using a clean graphical interface. Hardware elements include distance sensors which are necessary to detect cars and return data. Increased functionality may include a mobile application, off-\/site data storage, and increased data about specific parking spots (proximity to buildings, shade, timing, etc.).
